```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Data comes from http://insideairbnb.com/

### Task A

We first have the airbnb apartments data from London already cleaned with the file *airbnb_london_cleaner.R* priorly provided.

```{r}
df <- readRDS('airbnb_london_listing.rds')
```

We then run an automated analysis report with the library DataExplorer *(coming from http://boxuancui.github.io/DataExplorer/)* in order to spot potential next decisions.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(DataExplorer)
create_report(df)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
